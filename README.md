# Event-Driven Image Processing Pipeline with AWS Lambda and S3
This project demonstrates how to build an automated, event-driven image processing pipeline using AWS Lambda and S3. When an image is uploaded to a source S3 bucket, an AWS Lambda function is triggered, which processes the image by pixelating it into five different resolutions: 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 64x64, using the Pillow (PIL) library. The processed images are then stored in a processed S3 bucket. This project leverages a fully serverless architecture, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.

## What You Will Learn:
* AWS Lambda Event-Driven Architecture: How to trigger Lambda functions in response to S3 events.
* Image Processing with Python (Pillow Library): Techniques for manipulating images, including pixelation.
* S3 Bucket Operations: How to manage objects across multiple S3 buckets, including permissions and event notifications.
* Error Handling and Optimization: Implementing best practices for error handling in Lambda functions.
* Serverless Deployment: Experience deploying a fully serverless pipeline on AWS, ideal for real-time, automated tasks.

## Where Pixelation is Used:
Pixelation can be useful in several scenarios, including:

* Privacy Protection: Pixelating parts of images, such as faces or sensitive areas, is often used in media or public content to anonymize individuals.
* Creative Design: Pixelated images are popular in retro or abstract art, game design, and for stylized visual effects.
* Data Reduction: In applications where reduced image resolution is needed for quick previews or when bandwidth is limited, pixelation can be used to create smaller image files.
* Video and Image Compression: Pixelated previews are useful in scenarios where image or video quality can be progressively enhanced as more data is loaded.
* Blur Detection and Machine Learning: Pixelation can also be used in preprocessing images to test machine learning models on recognizing shapes, patterns, or when reducing visual noise is necessary for certain types of analysis.

## Project Solution:

### Stage 1: Create the S3 Buckets
  * Bucket 1: amc-image-pixelater-source
  * Bucket 2: amc-image-pixelater-processed

### Stage 2: Develop the Lambda Function Code:
  * Create a folder named ```my_lambda_deployment```.
  * Move into that folder (```cd my_lambda_deployment```).
  * Create a folder called ```lambda```.
  * Move into that folder (```cd lambda```).
  * Create a file called ```lambda_function.py``` and paste in the code for the pixelator [Lambda function](https://github.com/yeshwanthlm/image-pixelater-aws-project/blob/main/lambda_function.py).
  * Download this file [PIL](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f3/3b/d7bb231b3bc1414252e77463dc63554c1aeccffe0798524467aca7bad089/Pillow-9.0.1-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl) Package into that folder.
  * Run ```unzip Pillow-9.0.1-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl``` and then ```rm Pillow-9.0.1-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl```. These are the Pillow module files required for image manipulation in Python 3.9 (which the lambda function will be using).
  * From the same folder, run ```zip -r ../my-deployment-package.zip .``` which will create a lambda function zip, containing all these files in the parent directory.
  * This zip will be the same zip which is linked below, so if you have any issues with the lambda function, you can use the one that's pre-created.

### Stage 3 - Create and Configure the Lambda Function

### Stage 4 - Test and Monitor

## Outcome:
By the end of this project, you will have a complete event-driven image processing pipeline capable of automatically pixelating images at multiple resolutions, with the processed images stored in a separate S3 bucket. This architecture is scalable, efficient, and can be adapted for other image processing tasks, providing a practical example of serverless computing in action.
